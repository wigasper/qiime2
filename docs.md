## Feature tables
### What is a feature table?

The feature table generated by DADA2 is the critical data for everything going forward. Essentially this is just data representing the counts of each OTU (picked from the sequences) in each sample. It's in `biom` format, which is HDF5. HDF5 allows for efficient storage of sparse data, but is serialized and not human readable. This can easily be converted to a dense, human-readable matrix with `biom convert`.
The dense matrix is then simply a contingency table (like a spreadsheet), where each row represents a different OTU and each column represents a sample, and the values at each position represent the count of the OTU in the respective sample. `biom convert` can also output relative frequencies for each OTU. 
After assigning taxonomy, the OTU identifiers can then be mapped to taxonomic identifiers using the `taxonomy.tsv` file.
